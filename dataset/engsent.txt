Is Tom living in Boston?
Is Tom still interested?
Is all this money yours?
Is everything all right?
Is he a friend of yours?
Is he married or single?
Is it about ten o'clock?
Is it all under control?
Is it any warmer inside?
Is it not a bit extreme?
Is it raining right now?
Is it something serious?
Is it worse than before?
Is my explanation clear?

It all happened quickly.
It all seems so strange.
It can't be that simple.
It could be big trouble.
It feels like an orange.
It gives me the shivers.
It happens all the time.
It happens to all of us.
It is I who am to blame.
It is dark in that room.
It is fun to play cards.
It is just five o'clock.
It is likely to be fine.
It is not for beginners.
It is pretty cold today.
It is pretty warm today.
It is rather warm today.
It is their only choice.
It is time to go to bed.
It isn't anyone's fault.
It isn't the same thing.
It keeps me up at night.
It looks a little heavy.
It looks like a wedding.
It made me a little sad.
It may be our only hope.
It may be the last time.
It may freeze next week.
It may rain around noon.
It may rain at any time.
It must be hard for you.
It needs to be repaired.
It should be no problem.
It took exactly an hour.
It was Sunday yesterday.
It was Tom who did that.
It was a computer error.
It was a fine sunny day.

It was a trick question.
It was an exciting game.
It was cloudy yesterday.
It was dark in the room.
It was extremely simple.

It was out of his reach.
It was probably nothing.
It was quiet all around.
It was snowing that day.
It was too cold to swim.
It was truly depressing.
It was very interesting.
It wasn't what I wanted.
It went without a hitch.
It will be hot tomorrow.
It won't take that long.
It wouldn't surprise me.
It'd be easy to do that.
It's Tom I want to meet.
It's a bit intimidating.
It's a fascinating read.
It's a legitimate worry.
It's a misunderstanding.
It's a quarter to three.
It's a stupid tradition.
It's a very steep slope.
It's all behind you now.
It's all total nonsense.
It's all your own fault.
It's almost six o'clock.
It's almost unbreakable.
It's always worth a try.
It's an ongoing process.
It's awfully cold today.
It's back to square one.
It's because I love you.
It's been so many years.
It's been taken care of.
It's completely natural.
It's computer-generated.
It's entirely up to you.
It's fun to play tennis.
It's getting ridiculous.
It's going to be tricky.
It's going to rain soon.
It's great for families.
It's healthy and normal.
It's just a scratch, OK?
It's just an expression.
It's just the two of us.
It's kind of a bad time.
It's kind of comforting.
It's kind of disgusting.
It's my biggest problem.
It's no concern of mine.
It's no laughing matter.
It's no use complaining.
It's not at all typical.
It's not dinnertime yet.
It's not in my contract.
It's not like you think.

It's not that difficult.
It's not the first time.
It's not the real thing.
It's not the same thing.
It's not very important.
It's not what you think.
It's not worth the pain.
It's not worth the wait.
It's only the beginning.
It's part of the system.
It's popular with women.
It's possible, isn't it?
It's raining everywhere.
It's really infuriating.
It's really windy today.
It's shocking, isn't it?
It's still not finished.
It's the correct answer.
It's the right decision.
It's time for you to go.
It's time to plan ahead.
It's very hot, isn't it?
It's worth a try, right?
It's worth checking out.
It's your turn to speak.
Japan is a rich country.
Jump as high as you can.
Just answer my question.

It was worth every penny.
It wasn't all that funny.
It wasn't me. It was Tom.
It wasn't much of a plan.
It wasn't much of a view.
It wasn't much of a yard.
It will not happen again.
It won't cost you a dime.
It won't hurt, I promise.
It'll happen to you, too.
It'll only take a minute.
It's a basic human right.
It's a beautiful picture.
It's a bunch of nonsense.

It's for my personal use.
It's for your own safety.
It's good to talk to you.
It's hard being a parent.
It's hot today, isn't it?
It's in my jacket pocket.
It's incredibly powerful.
It's junk. Throw it away.
It's just the right size.
It's kind of complicated.
It's making me nostalgic.
It's my duty to help you.
It's my fault, not yours.
It's no longer available.
It's none of my business!

It's the end of the year.
It's the house specialty.
It's the least we can do.
It's the same every year.
It's the truth, isn't it?
It's time to get serious.
It's time to go to sleep.
It's too early to get up.
It's too good to be true.
It's unlikely to be true.
It's warm enough to swim.
It's working as intended.
It's your responsibility.

It may, indeed, be a mistake.
It might rain before evening.
It must've happened that way.
It rained for an entire week.
It rained hard all day today.
